Conveying a new perception to the retro running shape, the GEL-KAYANO™ 14 running shoe resurfaces with its late 2000s aesthetic as a nod to our storied GEL-KAYANO™ series.

Reinterpreting the shoe's performance capabilities with updated materials and componentry, this version became the first iteration in the sneaker's lineage to be designed by someone other than Toshikazu Kayano. This torch's passing would also reignite the franchise's signature values while making advancements in its performance evolution.

Mirroring the original midsole tooling with GEL™ technology cushioning, this shoe also improves the fit of the upper while retaining its layered leather and mesh construction from 2008. Additionally, the sockliner is produced with a solution dyeing process that reduces water usage by 33% and carbon emissions by approx. 45%
