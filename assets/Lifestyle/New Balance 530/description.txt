The original MR530 combined turn of the millennium aesthetics with the reliability of a high milage running shoe. The reintroduced 530 applies a contemporary, everyday style outlook to this performance-minded design. A segmented ABZORB midsole is paired with a classic mesh and synthetic overlay upper design, which utilizes sweeping curves and angles for a distinctive, high-tech look.
