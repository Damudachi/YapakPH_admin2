High-tops changed the sneaker game, and the Vans Style #38 was at the forefront of the revolution. Now beloved as the Sk8-Hi sneaker, this legendary high-top shoe blazed trails from the beginning. The sturdy suede and canvas uppers allow for maximum attitude. The foundation? Say hello to reinforced toe caps, supportive padded collars, and our signature rubber waffle outsoles. This classic Sk8-Hi shoe is as innovative today as it was in 1978, and every bit as groundbreaking. Tapping into our heritage, the Black &amp; White Sk8-Hi has it all.
