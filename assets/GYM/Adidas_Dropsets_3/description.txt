Strength training shoes for stable support.
Whether lifting, pushing or pulling, Dropset 3 trainers provide the stable support needed for strength training. A dual-density midsole keeps feet cushioned through intense reps, while a TPU sidewall locks in the midfoot. adidas HEAT.RDY keeps feet cool even when the workout heats up. Wider than standard fit, these trainers comfortably contain any foot swell from exertion.
