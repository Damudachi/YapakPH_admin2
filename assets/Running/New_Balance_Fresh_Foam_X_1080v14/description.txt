If we only made one running shoe, it would be the Fresh Foam X 1080. The unique combination of reliable comfort and high performance offers versatility that spans from every day to race day. The Fresh Foam X midsole cushioning is built for smooth transitions from landing to push-off, while a soft, premium upper provides support and breathability.

Updates to the v14 include a new, triple jacquard mesh upper with increased breathability in key areas, an updated outsole for a propulsive feeling, and additional rubber in high wear areas for added durability.
