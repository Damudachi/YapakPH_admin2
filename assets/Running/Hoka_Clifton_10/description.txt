Light and plush for everyday miles.

A trusted trainer for daily maintenance miles, the Clifton has been the keystone of our cushioned styles for 10 years and counting. Ushering in a new era of plush performance, this next-generation update delivers a revitalized underfoot experience with an additional 3mm in heel-to-toe drop. Delivering the same ultralight cushioning that made the Clifton a fan favorite, weâ€™ve fine-tuned the fit and added a breathable jacquard upper with double-lace lock to mitigate tongue migration.
